            What is the GreenGuard Safety Agent?
          </h2>

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            The <strong>GreenGuard Safety Agent</strong> is an intelligent, agent-driven
            safety layer designed to operate alongside traditional navigation systems.
            Instead of optimizing only for distance or time, GreenGuard continuously
            reasons about <strong>environmental safety conditions</strong> that impact
            human health during a journey.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            GreenGuard does not attempt to replace navigation apps. Instead, it acts as a
            <strong> decision-support companion</strong>, observing the environment,
            evaluating risk, and intervening only when safety truly matters.
          </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">👀 Observe</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              GreenGuard continuously observes the user’s live location and gathers
              surrounding environmental signals such as <strong>air quality (AQI)</strong>
              and <strong>wind conditions</strong> using real-world public data sources.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-8 border-t-4 border-green-500">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">🧠 Decide</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Using deterministic, profile-aware logic, the agent evaluates safety risk
              and detects <strong>meaningful changes</strong> in environmental conditions,
              rather than reacting to every minor fluctuation.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-lg p-8 border-t-4 border-red-500">
            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">🚨 Act</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              When risk thresholds are crossed, GreenGuard proactively generates
              <strong> clear, human-readable safety advisories</strong>, delivered visually
              and through voice alerts — without overwhelming the user.

            GreenGuard Design Philosophy
          </h2>

          <ul className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 text-lg">
            <li>
              • <strong>Agent-first architecture:</strong> Built explicitly around the
              Observe → Decide → Act loop, not passive data dashboards.
            </li>
            <li>
              • <strong>Non-intrusive by design:</strong> Alerts trigger only when safety
              severity changes, preventing alert fatigue.
            </li>
            <li>
              • <strong>Responsible AI usage:</strong> AI is used to explain and
              communicate risk, not to make opaque or irreversible decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              • <strong>Graceful degradation:</strong> GreenGuard continues operating
              even if AI services are unavailable.

            Why GreenGuard Matters
          </h2>

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Environmental risks during travel are often invisible — pollution hotspots,
            sudden drops in air quality, or unfavorable wind conditions can directly
            impact health, especially for cyclists, pedestrians, and individuals with
            respiratory sensitivities.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            GreenGuard makes these hidden risks visible and actionable, empowering users
            to make <strong>safer, more informed travel decisions</strong> without adding
            complexity to their navigation experience.
